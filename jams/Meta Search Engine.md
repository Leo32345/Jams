# Build Your Own Meta Search Engine!

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create a search engine that gets search results from Google's Search API (free). This lets you customize the way your internet search results look and gives you an extra layer of privacy over your search results by making it harder for Google to track your search history. This jam will teach participants about PHP and Google's search API.

_Requirements:_ Repl.it Account, Google Account (to access free Google Search API).

_Language used:_ PHP, HTML, CSS, JS (optional)

_Customization opportunity:_ You get to customize the look of your search engine using CSS! You can also add more functions such as search autocomplete using JS, or narrow your search results to only get specific types of results.
_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based Replit Development, so available on all platforms (+ App available on both iOS and Android)

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown

- Part 1: Build out front end of the website (input box and search button)
- Part 2: Set up free google search API
- Part 3: Write PHP to display results from API
- Part 4: Customize the site's appearance with CSS
- Success!

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
